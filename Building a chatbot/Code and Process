Objective:
Create a chatbot that can answer questions about healthy food, diet, and nutrition using GPT-4All and Python on a MacBook Air M2. 
This chatbot will serve the B2C segment of the startup for providing meal and nutrition-related insights.


Prerequisites:
Python (Ensure Python 3.x is installed).
GPT-4All model: We will use the GPT-4All model (a smaller version of GPT-4 that works well with local setups).
Install necessary Python packages:
gpt4all for handling GPT-4All model in Python.

Step 1: Setup the Project Directory
Create a folder for your chatbot project:

mkdir ~/chatbot
cd ~/chatbot

Step 2: Download the Model
Visit HuggingFace GPT-4All model page and download the model file ggml-nomic-ai-gpt4all-falcon-Q4_0.gguf. (search for this in your browser and download from 
hugging face)
Place the downloaded model file in the ~/chatbot/models/ directory.

Step 3: Install Required Python Packages
You need to install the gpt4all package to interact with the GPT-4All model. Run:

pip install gpt4all


Step 4: Create chatbot.py
Open a terminal and create a new Python file:

nano chatbot.py


Then paste the following code into the file:
import gpt4all

# Set the path to your model
model_path = "/Users/user/location/ggml-nomic-ai-gpt4all-falcon-Q4_0.gguf" (# use the location of the downloaded file)
 
# Initialize the model
llama = gpt4all.GPT4All(model_path)

def ask_question(question):
    # Get the response from the model using the generate method
    response = llama.generate(question, max_tokens=150)

    # Retry logic to handle cut-off responses, with a limit of 3 retries
    retries = 0
    while len(response.split()) < 20 and retries < 3:  # Adjust the retry condition
        print("Response was cut off, generating more text...")
        response = llama.generate(question, max_tokens=150)
        retries += 1

    if retries == 3:
        return "Sorry, I couldn't provide a complete answer. Please try again."

    return response.strip()

# Main loop to ask questions
while True:
    question = input("You: ")
    if question.lower() == 'exit':
        print("Exiting the chatbot. Goodbye!")
        break

    # Get the chatbot's response
    response = ask_question(question)
    
    # Print the response
    print("Chatbot:", response)


Step 5: Save and Run the Code
After pasting the code into the chatbot.py file in nano, press CTRL + O to save and CTRL + X to exit.
To run the chatbot, execute:

python3 chatbot.py


Step 6: Test the Chatbot
You can now interact with the chatbot by typing your questions into the terminal, such as:

"What are the top 3 fruits with the highest protein content?"
"Can you plan a healthy meal for tomorrow?"
