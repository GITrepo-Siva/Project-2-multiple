Healthy Food & Nutrition Chatbot

This project features a locally-run chatbot built using the GPT-4All model. It's designed to answer various queries related to healthy food, diet, nutrition, and meal planning. The chatbot operates offline and can be easily set up and used on a macOS system.

Features

Offline Operation: The chatbot runs entirely offline once set up.
Nutritional Information: Answers queries like "Which fruits are high in protein?" or "How many calories does a guava have?"
Meal Planning: Offers suggestions for meal planning based on user input.
Customizable: Modify the model or adjust response conditions to suit your needs.
Installation & Setup

To set up the chatbot, follow the steps below:

Clone or Download the Repository: Download the repository containing the chatbot script and necessary files.
Download the Model: Download the GPT-4All model from Hugging Face and store it in the specified directory.
Install Dependencies: Ensure that the required Python packages, including gpt4all, are installed.
Edit Script: Adjust the model path in the script to reflect where you have stored the model.
Run the Chatbot: Once the setup is complete, you can start the chatbot and begin interacting with it by entering queries in the terminal.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, check the following:

Ensure the model file is placed in the correct directory.
Verify that all required dependencies are installed and up to date.
If the responses are cut off, adjust settings in the script or ensure proper model loading.
